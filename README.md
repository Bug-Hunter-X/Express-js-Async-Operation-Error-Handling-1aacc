# Express.js Async Operation Error Handling
This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications involving asynchronous operations and improper error handling.  The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect implementation, where `res.send()` is placed prematurely, potentially masking errors in subsequent asynchronous operations. The solution, in `bugSolution.js`, showcases proper error handling and placement of `res.send()`.

## Problem
Asynchronous operations in Express.js often involve fetching data from databases or external APIs.  If you send the response (`res.send()`) before these operations complete, any subsequent errors will not be handled properly and might go unnoticed.

## Solution
The correct approach involves either using promises/async/await or callbacks to ensure that all asynchronous operations complete before sending the response. The example demonstrates the use of async/await for cleaner error handling and improved code readability.
